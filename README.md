Abstract: The vehicle industry of the United States represents about 50 percent of the country’s auto retail market with an annual sale of USD 350 billion. This massive share constitutes the largest market segment of the economy. With the impact of digital disruption to the market, online retailers and ecommerce websites have become a convenient channel of trading for consumers aiding in quick buy and sell.The digital transformation has fueled the availability of pricing information and more transparency in vehicle conditions thereby, avoiding middle parties like car dealerships and traders. Admittedly, this availability of information is productive for all the stakeholders, a downside is that consumers can view different price listings of a single car model on various websites on the internet. This could confuse the customers posing a dilemma about purchasing a model from a certain website. Our motivation is to address the primary interest of a consumer regarding purchasing a used car. We have focused on attributes which may positively impact in consumers making an informed decision. Our parameters include the price point of a used car, whether it is appropriate in terms of obtaining a good deal for a car, vehicle history reports, brand of the car, its geographical location, mileage, transmission, size type, et cetera.
